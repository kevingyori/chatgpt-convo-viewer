## 2024-03-22 - TUI Clear Button Interaction
**Learning:** When implementing a clear button for text inputs in a TUI, placing it immediately after the input (conceptually 'inline') and returning focus to the input upon click is crucial for maintaining keyboard flow.
**Action:** Always ensure clear buttons are keyboard accessible and manage focus correctly. Use `aria-label` for icon-only buttons.
